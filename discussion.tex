\section{Dataset diversity}
\label{dataset_divers}
As mentioned in chapter \ref{sec:test_on_trf}, Yolo performs almost perfectly on the \textit{trf} dataset, which could be an indication of overtraining. The \textit{trf} dataset consists of approximately 500 images taken in the Trondheimfjord during a ferry trip back and forth between Trondheim and Brekstad. The images were all captured the same day, under the same weather and lighting conditions. Also, due to a limited amount of boats at sea during the ferry trip, multiple images were captured of the same boats. Thus even though the images the detection models were tested on and trained on were separated, the images used in both testing and training had some common features. While this might give the impression that the results are biased, and not representative of how the algorithm would perform in a completely new environment, some arguments would suggest otherwise.

\vspace{3mm}

First of all, as shown in chapter \ref{sec:moored_boats}, Yolo2 and Yolo3 perform better than Yolo1 on the \textit{trf} dataset. All these detection models are trained on datasets \textit{bc}, \textit{bf} and \textit{trf}, while Yolo2 and Yolo3 are also trained on other datasets that do not contain similar images as \textit{trf}. This could imply that what improves the results of Yolo2 and Yolo3 suspiciously good on \textit{trf}, are not caused by overtraining on the \textit{trf} dataset, but rather the ability to recognize features in more diverse environments. While all the Yolo models perform worse on the \textit{bc} and \textit{bf} test dataset, they perform well on images that contain separated boats, similar to the photos in the \textit{trf} dataset. What makes them perform worse are images that include clusters of small boats, as shown in image \ref{fig:yolo3_clutter}.

In the majority of the images, Yolo3 also gets excellent results in this dataset, as shown in figure \ref{fig:yolo3_good_ex}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}

\end{figure}

In the images in figure \ref{fig:yolo3_clutter} it is not easy to correctly detect all the boats by human assessment either. When boats are separated, Yolo3 gets good results consistently. When vessels are more prominent, cluttering does not seem to be as problematic. This could partly be because big ships do not tend to stay very close together, and thus, the examples are fewer. An example of how Yolo1 handles three big tow boats close together is shown in \ref{fig:yolo1_clutter}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
  \centering

\end{subfigure}
\caption{Yolo1 on big boat clutter, red bounding boxes are detections, green bounding boxes are ground truth}
\label{fig:yolo1_clutter}
\end{figure}

In both figure \ref{fig:yolo1_clut_tow} and \ref{fig:yolo1_sep} there are three towboats. In figure \ref{fig:yolo1_clut_tow} one of the boats is partly covered by another, and the two boats are detected as one. This is not necessarily a problem, and as soon as the boats are separated, they are detected as three boats. 

\vspace{3mm}

One cannot rule out that the results are unaffected by overtraining. To verify if the detection model is overtrained or not one would have to evaluate it in completely unseen environments. At the same time, it does not serve any purpose to test the detection algorithm on a dataset that is nothing alike the \textit{trf} dataset, since this is the environment the algorithm is meant to perform well in. The \textit{trf} dataset contains many different types of boats and ships, it contains large camouflaged military vessels, small motor boats, and ferries, and is diverse relative to how different the boats and ships in the Trondheimfjord generally is. 

\vspace{3mm}

The accuracy of the results Yolo3 has on the \textit{trf} dataset might also be because the detection problem of maritime vessels in the Trondheimfjord is not where Yolo struggles. It will depend on each case, but the results in this project indicate that Yolo can robustly detect sailing boats in the Trondheimfjord under good weather conditions. To verify this claim one would need an even more diverse dataset, to ensure that the good results are not a consequence of overtraining. Still, there is no limit to how diverse a dataset could be and building a dataset that could verify this claim one hundred percent seems like an impossible task. 

\vspace{3mm}

That being said, the weather conditions do not vary much, neither in the test or training dataset. Ideally, a dataset with a diverse set of ships and boats under different weather conditions such as dark lighting conditions, fog and snow should be made. The Cloud Detection Framework can be easily used to address the different scenarios, but the compilation of a dataset for these conditions should be done in future research on this topic.

\section{Effect of training on buildings}
The effect of training on buildings seems to have a positive influence on the results. Yolo3 outperforms Yolo2 on all test datasets, and thus, this could indicate that training on a building class is beneficial for a boat detector. However, training on the building dataset also provides negative information for boat detection. By training on the building dataset, where there are no boats, the detector can also extract information about where there are no boats. Yolo3 has trained on the same boat objects as Yolo2, but Yolo3 could extract contextual information about the images in the building dataset, making it more able to identify objects that are not boats. This also conforms with the plot in figure \ref{fig:yolo_trf_prec}, where the Yolo3's precision is higher than Yolo2's, meaning Yolo3 has fewer misclassifications.

\subsection{Non-detected buildings in \textit{trf}}
\label{sec:build_trf}
In the \textit{trf} dataset, there are buildings in the background which Yolo3 does not detect, even though it is trained on a building class. The building dataset contains images taken in Trondheim close to Nidelva and a canal, and the buildings are in the majority of the images close up, as shown in figure \ref{fig:buildings}

\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{subfigure}
\caption{Example images from the buildings dataset}
\label{fig:buildings}
\end{figure}

In \textit{trf}, there are examples where Yolo3 fails to detect buildings, as shown in figure \ref{fig:yolo3_no_build}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{discussion/yolo3_no_build/IMG_2673.jpg}

  %\label{fig:yolo1_sep}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Yolo3 fails to detect buildings in the background}
\label{fig:yolo3_no_build}
\end{figure}


The buildings in figure \ref{fig:buildings} and in figure \ref{fig:yolo3_no_build} are in different scales. The results in this project indicate that training on images like the ones in figure \ref{fig:buildings} do not translate well to detecting buildings like the ones in figure \ref{fig:yolo3_no_build}. Still, the idea behind training a detection model on a building dataset was not that it should detect all the buildings in test datasets, but rather learn to not classify buildings as boats.

\section{Labeling}

During labeling of the dataset, the guidelines mentioned in chapter \ref{sec:labeling} was used. Three problems were encountered during the work with this project related to how the boats were labeled

\subsection{Labeling of sail boats}

As shown in figure \ref{fig:yolo3_sailboat} there are examples where sailboats are detected differently. In figure \ref{fig:yolo3_sailboat_whol} the whole sailboat is detected, with mast, in figure \ref{fig:yolo3_sailboat_part} the mast is not detected as a part of the boat. As can be seen in both figure \ref{fig:yolo3_sailboat_whol} and \ref{fig:yolo3_sailboat_part} sailboats are labeled with mast. Thus, the correct detection set by the labeling standards would include the mast, however, to detect the mast may not be necessary for an autonomous vessel. The shape of the sailboat hull is comparable to the hulls of motor boats and also larger ships. By labeling sailboats with the mast, instead of only the hull of the boat, the detector might be less likely to be able to generalize the hull shape. Labeling only the sailboat hull makes the boats more alike, which may make the detector model more certain when classifying.

\end{subfigure}
\caption{Yolo3 detects two sailboats differently}
\label{fig:yolo3_sailboat}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Using several boat classes}
Another option is to train on different boat classes, having one class for motor vessels, sailboats, cargo ships, kayaks and so on. The features of a kayak will be different from a military frigate and trying to classify all these as the same object might confuse the detector. Yet, this would require datasets for each boat class, which would require much more data than what was used in this project.

\subsection{Detecting boat parts}
\label{sec:boat_parts}
The detection models seem to struggle when boats are partly covered by other boats or objects, and will either only detect the foremost boat, or detect the two boats as one large object, as shown in figure \ref{fig:yolo3_good_ex}. To be able to correctly classify a boat that is partly covered as a boat, the detection algorithm has to recognize parts of boats as boats. If large parts of a boat are covered, a detector trained on non-covered boats will not robustly detect it. A possible solution could be to train an object detector on parts of boats and post-process the detections into full boat detections. This does not seem like an easy system to implement and would require a massive amount of data. 



\section{Clustered boats}
Both Yolo and SSD have good results when there is a limited amount of boats in the image, and they are separated. When small boats are clustered together, like in figure \ref{fig:yolo3_clutter} both detection algorithms have trouble detecting them. This is not surprising as it is hard to make out the boats individually, also by human assessment. 

\vspace{3mm}

For Yolo, there are two main ways of approaching this problem. Either the grid can be resized and that way Yolo can detect smaller objects. This because there will be more cells in the grid, thereby creating more object proposals. The other solution, which might work better in this case, is to identify where there might be clusters and run Yolo on this sub-region of the image. This would require some form of cluster detection, which has been done in \citep{VanEtten}, though on detection of boats in satellite images.
